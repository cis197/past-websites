## JavaScript (or ECMAScript) Basics and Syntax

---

class: med-large

# ES5 vs ES6?

- ES5 (or ECMAScript 2009), ECMAScript 5 is also known as ES5
- ES6 (aka ES2015) is the the most widely used version of ECMAScript.
- ES6 has a lot of syntax changes from ES5 and these changes are GOOD!!!

# So ES5 or ES6

Unless specified, you should be using ES6 because

- it's just BETTER than ES5
- it's just MUCH BETTER than ES5
- it's just SO MUCH BETTER than ES5

# Data Types

---

class: med-large

1. Numbers: `1, 2, 3, 1.28e4, NaN, Infinity`
2. Strings: `'xyz', 'foo \n', '\u2603'`
3. Boolean: `true, false`
4. Array: `[1, 2, 'ham', 'spam']`
5. Objects: `{ course: 'CIS 197', title: 'JavaScript' }`
6. Functions:

```javascript
// ES5 Syntax
var square = function (x) {
  return x * x
}

// ES6 Syntax
const square = x => x * x
```

---

class: center, middle, block-text

# Variable Declarations

---

class: med-large

- JS is weakly-typed
- Variables of any type is declared through 1 or 2 keywords

```js
// ES5 Syntax
var a = 3

console.log(a) // prints 3

// ES6 Syntax
let a = 3
const b = 3
```

---

class: med-large

# ES5: Hoisting

1. Before JavaScript executes a function, it looks for all `var` declarations within the current scope.
2. It then _declares_ all those variables but doesn't assign them (effectively executing the statement `var foo` at the top of the function).
3. Only then does the function block get executed. Assignment of a variable occurs when the function execution reaches the line where you actually assign a variable.

---

class: med-large

# Hoisting: Example 1

```js
a = 3
console.log(a) // what is printed out
var a
```

---

class: med-large

# Hoisting: Example 1

```js
// Hoisted vars
var a
a = 3
console.log(a)
```

---

class: med-large

# Hoisting: Example 2

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}

console.log(i)

if (true) {
  var xyz = 14
}

console.log(xyz)
```

---

class: med-large

# Hoisting: Example 2

```js
// Hoisted vars
var i, xyz

for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}

console.log(i) // Prints 10

if (true) {
  xyz = 14
}

console.log(xyz) // 14
```

---

class: med-large

- `let` works almost exactly like `var`, except it's _block-scoped_. It only exists inside the curly braces { } that it was declared in. An attempt to reference a variable declared with `let` outside of its scope is a ReferenceError.

- `const` is stricter still: a variable declared with `const` can _never be reassigned_. An attempt to do so will raise an error. This makes `const` very useful for declaring constants (like the number of degrees in a circle). In fact, it's good style to use `const` for _any_ variable that is never meant to be reassigned!

```js
a = 3
console.log(a) // Cannot access 'a' before initialization
let a
```

# Operators

---

class: med-large

1. Arithmetic: `+, -, *, /, %`
2. Comparison: `<, <=, >, >=, ==, ===, !=, !==`
3. Logical: `&&, ||, !`
4. Concatenation: `+`
5. Bitwise: `&, |, ~` (just fyi)

---

class: small

# Equality and Coercion

- `==` vs `===`
- Rule of thumb, use `===`
- Why?
  - `==` is _abstract equality comparison_
    - Will try and coerce both sides to the same type and make a comparison
  - `===` is the _strict equality comparison_
    - Won't attempt to coerce both sides to do a comparison. Just compares as is

```javascript
console.log(3 == '3') // true
console.log(3 === '3') // false
```

- _But_ when talking about objects both `==` and `===` will return `false` unless both sides refer to the exact same object.

<!-- ---

class: med-large

# Exercise #1: typeof

As the name would imply, the `typeof` function returns the type of the variable passed into it.

In your REPL, run the `typeof` function on `1`, `'string'`, `{ 'thisIs': 'anObject' }`, `[1,2,3]`

Example function call syntax for typeof

```javascript
typeof(1)
typeof('string')
...
```

### What do you get for the "array"?

---

class: med-large

#Gotcha

Arrays are technically objects. Keep this in mind for this homework and future ones as well. We can test for arrays explicitly using `Array.isArray(passInTheArrayHere)`.

We will get into this more formally during object oriented JS. But know that there is an `Array` constructor that `[1,2,...]` syntax is hiding with syntactic sugar. -->

---

class: med-large

# Numbers

- Stored internally as a 64-bit value (like Java's `double` type)
- `NaN` represents a non-number result
  - For example, `Number('xyz')` returns `NaN`
  - _CANNOT_ be compared using equality operators &ndash; <br>
    only `Number.isNaN()` may be used
- `Infinity` represents all numbers larger than `Number.MAX_VALUE`

---

class: center, middle, block-text

# Strings

---

class: med-large

- Strings can be written with single quotes or double quotes. **Use single quotes** - it's bad style to mix them.
  - _Exception_: Strings like `"I don't like double quotes"` that have single quotes inside them
- Escape characters use backslash, like Java: `'\n \t \\'`
- Strings are _immutable_ - once created, you can't change them
  - Concatenating them with the `+` operator returns a new string
- No `char` type - just use strings of length 1
- Many useful methods/properties &ndash; `.length, substring(), toLowerCase(), toUpperCase()` ...
  - See the full list in the [MDN string documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)

# ES6: Template Literals

---

class: med-large

Strings in JavaScript have always been fairly annoying to work with. You can't include variables without concatenating with +, and there aren't multiline strings either.

```js
var emotion = 'sad'
var str =
  'Oh ES5 strings\n' +
  'You make me so very ' +
  emotion +
  '\n' +
  'It is snowing on Mt. Fuji.'
```

---

class: med-large

ES6 supports a _template string_ syntax to get around these issues. Template strings are defined with backticks, and they support multiple lines and variable substitutions.

```js
const emotion = 'giddy with joy'
const str = `Template literals
You make me ${emotion}
It is snowing on Mt. Fuji.`
```

---

class: med-large

Template strings are actually much more powerful than just variable substitutions. You can put anything into a template's substitution expression, including function calls:

```js
const message = `The price is $ ${getItemCost()}`
```

## You can also define a _tag function_ to parse a template literal and make your own substitutions. This can be used to do common string manipulation tasks like HTML escaping really easily!

---

class: med-large

# Booleans

- `true` and `false`
- Standard logical operators (`&&, ||, !`)
  - Also bitwise operators (`&, |, ~`) - _don't use these!_ (well...you can if you know what you're doing)

---

class: med-large

# Quick Aside

JavaScript is weakly typed - you can use ANY value with a logical operator (fun...right?)

- _Falsy_ values: `false, null, undefined, 0, NaN, ''`
- Any other value is _truthy_ (including `'false', [], {}`)

---

class: med-large

# Arrays

- Literal notation uses square brackets: `['foo', 'bar', baz']`
- Can be heterogenous: `['foo', 1, true]` is valid
  - Contrast with Java, where elements must have the same type
- Elements accessed with square bracket notation: `arr[0]`
- Because arrays are instances of objects, they are passed referentially to functions!
- Convenience methods like `push(), pop(), slice(), shift(), unshift()`
  - See the full list in the [MDN Array documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

---

class: small

## Objects

- Lightweight, mutable key-value stores
- Literal notation uses curly braces: `{foo: 'bar', 'baz': 2}`
- Property names can be strings: `{'foo': 'bar'}`
- Access with `obj.propertyName` **or** `obj['propertyName']`

```javascript
var obj = {
  someProperty: 'abcdef',
  nestedObject: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 },
  func: function () {
    return 0
  },
}

// ES5 Syntax
obj.someProperty // --> 'abcdef'
obj['nestedObject'].a // --> 1
```

# ES6: Object Structuring & Destructuring

---

Objects come with some cool new features in ES6, and I really ðŸ¥°
them.

First comes **object structuring**, which allows you to assign a variable name to a property more concisely.

```js
let name = 'Carl', age = 22

// ES6 object structuring
let person = { name, age }

// ES5 equivalent
person = { name: name, age: age }
```

---

class: med-large

The next is **object destructuring**, which is the opposite of structuring. It lets you break down an object into properties, which you can then use as variables.

```js
let person = { name: 'Carl', age: 22, job: 'Farmer' }

let { name, age } = person

console.log(name) // prints Carl
console.log(age) // prints 22

```

You can also destructure arrays:

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3]
let [, second, third] = arr

console.log(second, third) // 2, 3
```

---

class: center, middle, block-text

# Functions

---

class: med-large

- First-class JS object (this allows JavaScript to take advantage of functional programming techniques)
- Functions can return a value with the `return` keyword
  - If no value is returned, then the function returns `undefined`

```javascript
// ES5 Syntax
var square = function (x) {
  return x * x
}

// ES6 Syntax
const square = x => x * x
```
---

class: center, middle, block-text

# ES6: => Functions

## a.k.a ðŸ˜Ž functions

---

class: med-large

Arrow functions are a tidier way to define a function in ES6. Rather than a function keyword, you can just use the following syntax:

```js
const func = () => {
  console.log('Func!')
  return 0
}
```

Arrow functions that are one line long do not even need braces or a return statement:

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b
console.log(add(1, 2)) // Prints 3
```

---

class: large

# Functions vs Calls

Don't get confused about the difference between a function call and the function itself! Remember, the call will always end with some parentheses.

```javascript
const square = x => x * x

console.log(square) // function
console.log(square(2)) // function call
```

---

class: large

# Loops

For loop

```js
for (var i = 0; i < Infinity; i++) {
  console.log('nihar is cool af')
}
```

While loop

```js
var niharIsCool = true
while (niharIsCool) {
  console.log('nihar is cool af')
}
```

class: med-large

# Looping through arrays

```js
// without using arrow functions
for (let i = 0; i < array1.length; i++) {
  ...
}

// with arrow functions
array1.forEach(elem => {
  ...
})

array1.forEach((elem, idx) => {
  ...
})
```

# Objects and `this`

---

class: med-large

# Everything is an Object

- Aside from the primitive types (String, boolean, and Number) - everything in JS is a kind of object
  - Even primitives can behave like objects (Strings, for example, have properties/methods)
- Array is an object with integer keys and specific methods (e.g. `splice(), indexOf()`)
- Functions are also object-like, and can have properties and methods
  - Can be thought of as _executable objects_

---

class: large

# The Global Object

- The highest-level parent entity
- If a function isn't assigned to an object, then its `this` context will be the _global object_ (`window` in a browser, `global` in Node).
- If a variable isn't declared within a function, it is assigned to the _global object_

---

class: med-large

## Scoping - or, Always Use Var

- Declaring a variable without `var` assigns it to the **global object** - `window` in the browser, `global` in Node
  - Declaring a variable **with** `var`, at the top level, also assigns to the global object...
- This is generally not what you want, and can cause issues.

```javascript
i = 4

// later, in another file
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // 'i' unintentionally overridden!
}
```

---

class: med-large

# Using `this`

- If a function is a property on an object, then we can access the parent object from within that function using `this`. Simple!

```js
var obj = {
  prop: 'I am a property.',
  printProp: function () {
    console.log(this.prop)
  },
}

obj.printProp() // -> 'I am a property.'
```

---

class: large

Since functions are objects, you might be wondering what happens if we reference `this` inside a function object itself.

```js
var func = function () {
  return this
}

console.log(func())
// [LOTS OF TEXT]
```

So what does `func()` actually return?

---

class: med-large

## Diagnosing Global Object Errors

```js
var numberPrinter = {
  num: 3,
  print2xNum: function () {
    var doubleThisNum = function () {
      return 2 * this.num
    }
    console.log(doubleThisNum())
  },
}

numberPrinter.print2xNum() // -> NaN
```

We wanted `2 * 3` -- what's going on here?

---

class: med-large

## Solution

```js
var numberPrinter = {
  num: 3,
  print2xNum: function () {
    var printer = this // new
    var doubleThisNum = function () {
      return 2 * printer.num
    }
    console.log(doubleThisNum())
  },
}

numberPrinter.print2xNum() // -> 6
```

---

class: large

Often, you'll see `var self = this` - which can be hard to read when it's overused. It's better to name the variable something that reflects its type (like `printer` in the previous example).

---

# Even better solution

Use the built-in `Function.bind()` to manually assign the internal function the correct `this` context!

```js
var numberPrinter = {
  num: 3,
  print2xNum: function () {
    var doubleThisNum = function () {
      return 2 * this.num
    }.bind(this) // new
    console.log(doubleThisNum())
  },
}

numberPrinter.print2xNum() // -> 6
```

# NPM (Node Package Manager)

---

class: med-large

# Node Modules

- In Node, dependencies are represented as [*modules*](http://
.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_require_id)
- Each file gets a `module` object representing the current module (duh)
  - Properties: `module.exports, module.require(), module.id, module.filename, module.loaded, module.parent, module.children`

```js
// myModule.js
var foo = [1, 2, 3, 4];

module.exports = foo;
// or, equivalently
exports = foo;
```

---

class: med-large

# Node Packages

- THE REASON WHY JAVASCRIPT IS SO POPULAR IS BECAUSE OF ITS EXTREMELY WELL-DONE PACKAGE ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT 
- Each NPM package is a folder representing a Node module
  - Hence the directory name: `node_modules`
- Each module has a `package.json` file with meta-information about the package
  - Including the main file to load with `require()`
- Packages are installed with `npm install package-name`
  - `npm install` installs dependencies from `package.json`
  - `npm install -g` installs a *global package*
  - `npm install --save` writes the package into the local `package.json` as a dependency

# Load Order
`require('X')` from module at path Y.

1. If X is a core module, then return X.
2. If X begins with './', '/', or '../'
  1. If X is a file, then load Y + X as a file.
      * "X.json" â†’ object
      * "X.node" â†’ binary add-ons
      * "X.js" or "X" â†’ JavaScript file
  2. If X is a directory, then load Y + X as a directory.
      * If "X/package.json" exists and has a "main" field,
        then load that file.
      * Else try to load "X/index.js", "X/index.json",
        and "X/index.node" (in that order).
3. Try loading X using LOAD_NODE_MODULES.
4. Throw a "Not Found" error.

---

class: med-large

# Loading Order, Part II

Again, `require('X')` from path Y.

```text
function LOAD_NODE_MODULES:
1. let PARTS = split_directory_path(Y)
2. let IDX = PARTS.length - 1
3. while IDX >= 0:
  1. if PARTS[IDX] == "node_modules" then continue
  2. let DIR = join_path(PARTS[0 ... IDX] + "node_modules")
      * Try loading "DIR/X" as a file
      * Try loading "DIR/X" as a directory
  3. let IDX = IDX - 1
```

**TAKEAWAY:** Node will attempt to load up the directory chain if it doesn't find a module locally. It will bubble all the way up to your global NPM folder (`~/node_modules`) &mdash; which can cause unexpected behavior. -->
