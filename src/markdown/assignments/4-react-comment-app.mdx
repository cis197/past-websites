  {`Similar to the Pokemon Map Builder homework, this assignment doesn't have any tests.
  The grade of your homework depends on the completion of required features.`}
</InfoMessage>

Note that there's no zipped implementation stub for this assignment.
That's because you're going to be totally building the app yourself!
The reason for this is that you will never master something until you know how to do it from sratch.
Having said that, the emoji searcher example we went through during class is definitely something you want to refer to in order to get started ðŸ˜‰

<!-- <InfoMessage showIcon>

  looking for at the bottom of this writeup. After this one, we will (actually
  this time) be going back to automated tests again ðŸ¥º`}

### Final Product

We want you to build an app with the following _functionality_.
By that we mean you by no means need to style the app to this extent (although some extent of styling is required),
we just care about the things we outline in the rubric. If you want to build out additional functionality or styles beyond what we mention, go for it!

### Recommendations

Be organized. Split things into helper files and small components. If you put everything in just a couple files, it can be really hard to debug and you'll lose style points.

For example, we can have one component for handling upvotes and downvotes, and we can call it `Voter.js`. Since the state in this app is all local, we don't need to even pass this component any props, it just maintains it's own `voteCount` state which starts out at zero and gets incremented and decremeneted depending on if users click upvote or downvote.

Components can render themselves. For example, if we have a `Reply.js` component, that component can have a recursive render function where it returns a new instance of itself in cases where there is a reply to a reply.

---

### Get Started

Refer to [lecture 4](/lectures/4-react#34) on how to setup Parcel + React.

Create a repo on GitHub, name it whatever you want, and clone it onto your local machine.

You can now proceed and do the same thing we did in class. (open a terminal, `cd` into the cloned folder, `npm init --y`, etc etc)

### User requirements

- As a user, I should be able to create a new post
  - I should not be able to create a post without entering my name and text (the button should not work)
- As a user, I should be able to reply to a post, also with my name and text
  - I should not be able to reply without providing my name and text
  - As a user, I can leave any number of replies to a post at a given depth
  - I should not be able to reply _beyond_ three levels of depth (for example, if we had original post â†’ first reply â†’ reply to reply, I could not write a reply to reply to reply)
- As a user, I should be able to upvote or downvote any post any number of times

**Note:** none of the state is persistent. There is no database or API. If we refresh the page, there is nothing which persists.

---

### Technical requirements

- Use **parcel** to bundle your app
- Write your app in ReactJS you learned from CIS 197, not the ReactJS you learned from some random tutorials or Stackover Flow
  - you should use **functional components** throughout the entire assignment
  - you should use **ES6 syntax**
- No errors in the developer tools console when clicking through the app
- Deploy the app to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (see below for the deployment guide)
- Maintain states in functional components via React Hook `useState`
- Use the same form component for creating a post and creating a reply
- Use the same upvote/downvote component for voting on posts and on replies to posts
- Use ESlint, the set up guide can be found at the bottom of the styles page
- You should not store **a list of components**
- Some extent of styling is expected
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
  - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  - CSS-related tools like [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) or [scss](https://sass-lang.com/)

Note: The state management is not complex enough to make Redux worthwhile, so **you DO NOT have to use Redux**

### Example components

#### Components that take user data
This component shows you how to take user input and store in state. Similarly, buttons have `onPress` props.

<Code code={`
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
 
export default () => {
  const [userInput, changeUserInput] = useState('')
  return (
    <input type="text" value={userInput} onChange={e => changeUserInput(e.target.value)} />
  )
}`} lang="jsx" />


#### Recursively Rendered Components
The component that captures post text and the author might need to be recursively rendered. Here's an example of a recursively rendered component.

<Code code={`
export const RecursivelyRenderedComponent = ({depth}) => {
  if (depth === 0) {
    // Base case
    return null
  }
  
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Depth: {depth}</h1>
      <RecursivelyRenderedComponent depth={depth - 1} />
    </>
  )
}
`} lang="jsx" />

### GitHub requirements

A good practice of GitHub is to only commit what is necessary for others to replicate your work.
Therefore, folders like `.parcel-cache`, `dist`, and `node_modules` should not be committed as
these are generated by `npm start` or `npm run dev` automatically and `node_modules` is generated
from `npm install`. In contrast, files like the React code you wrote and `package.json` would be crucial
because the React code produces the website and `package.json` lists all the packages being used.

So to avoid `git` tracking changes in the unnecessary folders, we create a file
in the root directory called `.gitignore` and put the following
```
.parcel-cache
node_modules
dist
```

Now, if you run `git add .` any changes made to files in these folders are ignored.

**Note: anyone who does not follow this practice gets a 5-point deduction, and this applies to all homeworks in the future where GitHub is used**

If you accidentally commited one of the above folders to GitHub, the quickest way is to
delete the repo, create a new one, and re-commit but with the folder names added to `.gitignore`.

### Deploying with Netlify

You can host this app wherever you want so long as there's a link we can visit it at. Netlify is one super easy way to deploy:

1. Create a Netlify account
1. Click the button to create a new website
1. Give it access to your GitHub account and pick the repo where you are pushing your code
1. add `"build": "parcel build ./src/index.html"` to `scripts` in `package.json`
1. Set the build command to `npm run build`
1. Set the publish directory to `dist`
1. Hopefully it builds and deploys without any issue. If it doesn't, Netlify's error messages can be pretty useful
1. If configured correctly, every push to the master branch of your GitHub repo will automatically trigger a re-build of the site

### What to submit

On Gradescope:

1. Link to the GitHub repository containing your code **and** the hash of your latest commit
1. Link to where your app is hosted in production
<!-- 1. Enumerate any sources which helped you in writing this app (for example, stackoverflow posts) -->

If you decide to make your GitHub repo private, please add every staff as a collaborator

### Grading

We will manually grade these submissions per the user and technical criteria outined above.
As per usual, there will also be 5 points for coding styles and 5 points for website styling.

### Disclaimer

This is a very free-form assignment and we recognize it's going to be tough for some people. If you have any questions about how you might do something, ask on Campuswire or in office hours and the TA's will try to be particularly helpful in pointing you in the right direction for this assignment.
