### Before starting this assignment

Review [Lecture 2](/lectures/2-callbacks-events-async/).

Install the async and node-fetch libraries by running `npm install` in the root of your homework directory.

We will be interacting with our own simplified version of the New York Times API (with our own wrapper around the API calls) to obtain metadata from articles published on their website. If you haven't worked with APIs before, here's a short article that explains [what they are](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/api-good-technology-explained/).

  <p>
    This notion of callback functions and the asynchronous flow of data can be
    difficult for people new to JS to understand. As a result, this HW has in
    the past proved particularly challenging for some people: take the time to
    really understand callback functions and the libraries we use and it will
    help you with both this HW and what's to come later in the class.

**Instructions**

- Visit the NYT developer website [by clicking here](https://developer.nytimes.com/accounts/create)
- Create an account (and verify your email)
- Select "Apps" from the account dropdown at the top right
- Click "+ New App"
- Fill out App Name and Description. Make sure that your Description makes sense. Select the following APIs:
  - Most Popular API
  - Article Search API
- Copy your API key, which is available under "API Keys"
- Paste this API key into `api/config.js` (in your project directory) and change the string `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` to whatever your api key ends up being. It should still look something like this

<Code
  code={`
module.exports = {
  apiKey: 'NoticeIStillHaveQuotesAroundThisString',
}
`}
  language="js"
/>

**Typically the NYT team will send you an API key within 30 minutes of submitting the form, but it is best to get issues resolved earlier rather than later.**

## Overview: API Interactions

In this assignment, you'll be writing a Node script that uses _callback functions_ and _async/await_ to interface with the NYT API. The final product will output the five topics that are currently most popular among NYT readers, as well as links to recent articles related to each of the topics. This kind of script can serve as an easy way for someone without a lot of time to keep up with trending news.

You'll need to accomplish three main tasks:

1. Fetch the weekly most viewed articles using the NYT Most Popular/Article Search API.
2. Determine the five most frequently used keywords by parsing JSON data.
3. Fetch and display articles related to the keywords using the NYT Search API.

Although there are quite a few moving parts involved, the [async.js](https://caolan.github.io/async/v3/) library will help us pull the methods you write together into a streamlined, easily refactored script.

## Part 1: Fetching popular articles

**`pullTrendingArticles.js`**

In order to obtain the data we need, we'll need to somehow make requests to the NYT API in our code. Previously, we used the [request](https://github.com/request/request) library to do this, but that has since been depracated. So we've decided to move on to [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch), which is actually just an implementation of the [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API built into most browsers. What's the difference between the two? [Request](https://github.com/request/request) is callback based while [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch) is promise based. The differences will become clearer in the following code examples. Conveniently, we've put the logic to handle all of these low level requests within `api/nyt.js`. From your end, all you need to interact with is the resulting functions from the `nyt` wrapper we gave you.

But regardless, it is useful to cover. Since we haven't covered HTTP in class yet, you don't need to worry about how request is communicating with NYT servers.

Here's a simple example of request in action:

<Code
  code={`
// request library
const request = require('request')
request('http://www.google.com', (error, response, body) => {
  if (!error && response.statusCode === 200) {
    console.log(body) // Show the HTML for the Google homepage.
  }
})
`}
  language="js"
/>

Notice how `request` is asynchronous: after it receives a response from the URL (the first argument), it passes the information to a callback function (the second argument). Thus, the callback function is only actually called when the API gives us a response which we format as a tuple `(error, response, body)`.

Here's a simple example of node-fetch in action:

<Code
  code={`
// node-fetch library
const fetch = require('node-fetch')
const getData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('http://www.google.com')
    if (response.status !== 200) {
    	throw new Error()
    }
    const body = await response.text() // HTML for the google homepage.
  } catch (error) {
    // handle error
  }
}
`}
  language="js"
/>

### Explanation of NYT Wrapper Library

For this assignment, we made a wrapper around the API requests in `api/nyt.js` (using the `node-fetch` library). So for this part of the homework, if you wish to make a call to get the most popular articles and their metadata, you can just do the following

<Code
  code={`
const nyt = require('./api/nyt')
 
nyt.mostPopular((err, res, body) => {
  console.log(res.statusCode) // -> 200
  console.log(body) // -> all the content
  console.log(err) // -> null
})
`}
  language="js"
/>

As you see, we are passing in a callback function that accepts the response data as parameters. In part 3 of this assignment, we again use this NYT wrapper library, but in a slightly different manner to practice using async/await. We'll explain more when we get there.

**TODO:** Write `pullTrendingArticles`.

This function will get metadata of the most popular articles by calling `nyt.mostPopular` and handling its response via a callback (look at the code example above to see what the function signature of your callback should be). Notice that the `pullTrendingArticles` function header accepts a `callback` argument.

Note that we need to handle errors from the `nyt.mostPopular` request as well. For instance, what if the internet cuts out while the script is running? For all the methods in this assignment, the callback function (for the `nyt.mostPopular` call) will take an error (possibly null) as the first argument, and any actual data as subsequent arguments. If there weren't any errors and the response status code is `200`, pass `null` and the response's `body` to the callback. For all other cases, pass an error to the callback. It is possible that the error is `null` and `response.statusCode` is not 200; in these cases, make sure to create and pass an error to the callback function. As a refresher, we create errors like so

<Code
  code={`
const error = new Error('SOME USEFULL ERROR MESSAGE')
`}
  lang="js"
/>

To test out your functionality: Create a file called `testHw2.js` (or whatever you want) with the following contents:

<Code
  code={`
const pullTrendingArticles = require('./pullTrendingArticles') // import the function from the pullTrendingArticles file
 
pullTrendingArticles(function(error, response) {
  if (error) console.log('OOPS: ' + error)
  console.log(response)
})
`}
  lang="js"
/>

This should pring a huge string that looks like `{"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2020..."}`

You can run this file by executing `node testHw2`. Make sure that this component of the homework works before moving on.

## Part 2: Parsing the JSON metadata

**`countKeywords.js`**

The article metadata we just grabbed is formatted in JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a very popular way of formatting data being sent across the web, primarily from a server to a web page. Syntactically, JSON is almost identical to the code for creating a JavaScript object (ie key value pairs), which makes it very easy to parse into a plain old JavaScript object. From there, we can process or manipulate the data however we seem fit. In our case, this will be extracting the most frequently used keywords.

[Here](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) is a short and sweet explanation of JSON, and [these](https://json.org/example.html) are some JSON examples. If you haven't seen JSON before, **read these before continuing.**

Now, our next task is to find article keywords and keep track of how many times they show up. To do this, we want to look at the `results` field of the JSON data, which is an array of JSON objects, each representing a different article. Within each article's JSON, there is a field containing a list of its keywords: `adx_keywords`. Its text value might look something like this:

```text
Forests and Forestry;Firearms;Federal Lands;Hikes and Hiking;National Rifle Assn;Colorado;Utah
```

Note how each keyword is separated by a semicolon.

**TODO:** Write `countKeywords`.

This function should parse the metadata JSON and return an array containing the five most frequently used keywords, _in descending order of popularity_, to its callback.

While parsing, you'll need some sort of updatable data structure to keep track of keywords as they appear and their frequencies (using an object as a dictionary is a good approach here). After parsing you should find the five keywords that appeared the most. An elegant approach, although not the only way, is to create an array from the keywords and use JavaScript's [Array.sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort), passing in a comparator function.

If you want to see what the actual JSON response from the New York Times looks like, you can go to the API endpoint in your browser (using your API key): `https://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/viewed/1.json?api-key=your-api-key-here`.

**NOTE**: The JSON data is being passed in as a string, so you want to first convert it into a JavaScript object. To do this, you might want to look at [JSON.parse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse). If there is an error trying to parse the JSON, you will want to pass the error along to the callback.

**NOTE**: Sometimes the keywords have trailing whitespace. You can use the [trim method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/Trim) to get rid of this before adding them to your data structure. Another useful method is [split](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split), which splits a string along a separator character. This will make it a lot easier to deal with the text in `adx_keywords`, once you isolate it.

To test the function, update your test file to now import countKeywords.js and console.log the expected results. Here is what your test file should be (note from here on out, we won't give you test file but will give expected output at every step):

<Code
  code={`
const pullTrendingArticles = require('./pullTrendingArticles')
const countKeywords = require('./countKeywords')
 
pullTrendingArticles((error, response) => {
  countKeywords(response, (cKerror, topKeywords) => {
    console.log(cKerror)
    console.log(topKeywords)
  })
})
`}
  lang="js"
/>

Make sure that this component of the homework works before moving on.

Output should look something like this:

```text
request processed
null
[
  'Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)',
  'United States Politics and Government',
  'Stocks and Bonds',
  'Financial Brokers',
  'GameStop Corporation'
]
```

## Part 3: Finding related articles

**`pullRelatedArticles.js`**

We now have an array containing five trending keyword strings sorted by popularity. For now, let's focus on finding the related articles for a single entry in the array. We'll once again be using request.js, but this time, we'll query the [Search API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/overview) with our keyword string.

**TODO:** Write `pullRelatedArticles`. This function takes in a query and a callback, and uses the request library to grab the data.

We want article metadata from the 10 (that's the default) most _recent_ articles that show up as search results for our query. The response format will again be JSON. After checking for any errors or inappropriate status codes, you should pass to the callback an object containing two fields: `query`, with the query you used, and `JSON`, with the response's `body`. Recall that the callback takes in (in this case), two parameters: `error` and `response`.

As mentioned before, we will again be using the NYT wrapper library, specifically the `articleSearch` function. However, this time we will not be passing in a callback, but instead be receiving a promise as the return type. This way, we can use async/await like we do in the following example:

<Code
  code={`
const nyt = require('./api/nyt')
 
const example = async (query) => {
  try {
    const res = await nyt.articleSearch(query)
    console.log(res.response.statusCode) // -> 200
    console.log(res.body) // -> all the content
  } catch (err) {
    // handle errors here
  }
}
`}
  language="js"
/>

We can't quite pass in the array of all the popular keywords we got from the last function (countKeywords) to test this. However for testing, you can do a call like

<Code
  code={`
pullRelatedArticles('Williams, Serena', (...you put in args here...) => {
  ...do what you need to here
})
`}
  lang="js"
/>

Ultimately an output of pullRelatedArticles should give to its callback something like the following result (if there are no errors):

<Code
  code={`
{
  query: 'United States Politics and Government',
  JSON: '{"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2018 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","response":{"docs":[{"web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/09/11/world/europe/11reuters-spain-politics-catalonia-explainer.html","snippet":"At the height of the crisis over Catalonia\'s secession drive last year, thousands of companies moved their legal headquarters out of the region, the Madrid stock market and government ...
}
`}
  lang="js"
/>

---

## Part 4: Streamlining callbacks with async.js

**`processKeywords.js`**

It would be pretty convenient if you could apply the `pullRelatedArticles` method you just wrote to each entry in the keyword array. Well, the asyncJS library allows you to [do just that](https://caolan.github.io/async/v3/docs.html#map) in a single line of code. We want to map each keyword we obtained from the previous step through pullRelatedArticles to create a new array containing related articles for each keyword.

For example, we might have the keywords `['Williams, Serena', 'B, Taras']`. Then, the callback should be called with an array that looks like this `[{articles_related_to_serena}, {articles_related_to_taras}]`.

**TODO:** Write `processKeywords`.

_Note:_ In order to understand the `map` how this function works, it's essential to read the provided documentation, linked [here](https://caolan.github.io/async/v3/docs.html#map).

Update `testHw2.js` to look like this:

<Code
  code={`
pullTrendingArticles((error, response) => {
  console.log(error)
  console.log(response) // <- this is just the general trending articles responses
 
  countKeywords(response, function(error, topKeywords) {
    console.log(error)
    console.log(topKeywords) // <- this is the top keywords parsed out of those trending articles
 
    processKeywords(topKeywords, function(err, rel) {
      console.log(err)
      console.log(rel) // <- this is an array of (large) JSON objects (each of which contains a bunch of articles for each keyword from the previous step
    })
  })
})
`}
  lang="js"
/>

Make sure that this component of the homework works before moving on.

## Part 5: Putting it all together

**`getTrendingKeywords.js`**

We're almost done - now we just have to link all the methods we wrote together. With so many callbacks involved, it's easy for our code to get messy. The async library has another good solution, in the form of the [waterfall](https://caolan.github.io/async/v3/docs.html#waterfall) control flow function.

`async.waterfall` allows us to chain function calls that take callbacks together, passing the result of each function to the next until the final callback. Piecing everything together, we first want to retrieve data on the most popular articles as a JSON string, then parse through the JSON to extract an array of the five most popular keywords, and then finally process that array by finding related articles for each keyword.

Using `waterfall` is optional. Any code that successfully weaves together the callbacks is fine, although a waterfall implementation is highly recommended because it's simply better style than marching callbacks. It also allows for a concise solution, only requiring a single function call.

**TODO:** Write `getTrendingKeywords`. The provided method, `displayRelatedArticles`, will be passed in as the callback argument. It takes in an array of objects, each of which has a `query` and a `JSON` field (hint: look at what `processKeywords` returns).
