# CIS 197 F21 Final Project Document

The final project consists of 2 milestones and a presentation. Milestones exist so that you are incentivized to not hold off working on your project until the very last moment. JavaScript is BUGGY and having the foresight to see JS bugs isn‚Äôt something that comes until you‚Äôve completed many projects.

## Basic Requirements

Though the choice of what your project should accomplish is up to you, we have a few basic requirements that must be a part of your application. If you have an idea that you really want to build but doesn‚Äôt meet the criteria below, then you can speak to a TA for override. Otherwise, every final project must

- Have a notion of users and accounts
- Use database
- Have a frontend
- Use express (backend)
- Use a package/ framework that's not covered in class (see more details in the rubric below)

Other than these requirements, you‚Äôre free to build whatever you want.

### Examples of previous final projects

- Collaborative, realtime drawing in 3D-space using three.js, socket.io
- Real-time Spotify Streaming within a group of users
- Convenience tool that controls room lights

### Cool || Useful Frameworks/Libraries

- Passportjs (for managing users and logins, ‚ÄòLogin with Facebook‚Äô, ‚ÄòLogin with Google‚Äô)
- Mongoose (for interfacing with MongoDB databases)
- Sequelize (for interfacing with MySQL databases)

### Final Project Ideas (most haven‚Äôt been done)

- A better when2meet that actually works on mobile and isn't from the 1990s... (and integrates with your google calendar or iCal CalDAV/rss feed... my my that would be amazing)
- React Native application for organizing spontaneous meetups with friends
- Messenger Bot for roommate management (schedule chores, split bills, add grocery items, and add check in functionality for all roommates). Node backend + Mongodb + facebook messenger API
- Social network (tinder but for dogs... or something like that) with the ability to create profiles, share content, and friend users. React + Redux frontend + node backend + mongodb needed
- Extension of any of the homeworks (but be sure to consult us on this to see if it is reasonably complex enough e.g. Redoing the stock portfolio but in react)

## Rubric
**Milestones (10 points)**
- Proposal (5 points)
- Milestone 1 (2.5 points)
- Milestone 2 (2.5 points)

**Frontend (35 points)**

Main areas that we are looking for
- State management
- React hooks/ life cycle methods
- Routing
- Styling/ Design

**Backend (35 points)**

Main areas that we are looking for
- Express Server
- Session management
- API endpoints
- MongoDB Integration


**Technicality (10 points)**

We expect at least 1 additional package/ framework (but obviously the more the better) that's not covered in the class
to be used in the final project. Examples include
- OAuth using Passportjs
- External APIs (RapidAPI, etc)
- React frameworks (GatsbyJS/ NextJS/ React Native)
- GraphQL

**Creativity (10 points)**

Think outside the üì¶‚ùóÔ∏è

## Step 1: Project Proposal + TA approval - 5 points

### Due Dates

Proposal Submitted: **Wednesday, November 17**

TA Approval: **Friday, November 19**

You‚Äôll need to writeup and submit a final project proposal on GradeScope by Wednesday, November 17. The project proposal should consist of the following items

- Overview (brief description of what you hope to build and what your project will accomplish)
- Feature list (detailed view into what users will be able to do on your application)
- Technologies/frameworks/libraries needed or used
- Milestone breakdown (what features you will accomplish by which milestone)

Proposal need not be long, it can simply be a couple of bullet points. But make sure you explain everything clearly so TAs can understand.
After you‚Äôve submitted your proposal, your assigned TA will contact you through email. They‚Äôll help you scope your project well and choose the appropriate libraries.

## Step 2: Milestones 1 & 2 (2.5 points each)

Milestones are meant to keep you making progress. Therefore, these are only graded by completion, if we see that your have made progress compared
to the previous commit, you will get full points.
**Submit the related GitHub info to Gradescope and update the README file in the repo with your progress.**

### Due Dates

#### Milestone 1: Monday, November 22

<!-- Your milestone 1 submission should simply consist of a link to your Github repository. For now, the latest commit is the one we will go off of to grade milestone 1 submissions.
There will be an assignment on GradeScope for you to submit.
Make sure your repository is public or if wish to make your repo private, add all TAs as collbarators. -->

#### Milestone 2: Monday, November 29

<!-- Milestone submission guidelines will be updated in the near future. They will likely be done by tracking commits on Github. -->



---

## Step 3: Final Presentation

<!-- Everyone has to show up for both days. _Attendance will be taken_

### Dates

Presentation day 1: December 3rd (class time)

Presentation day 2: December 5th (class time) -->

You have to present your web/mobile app to the instructor on either Sunday 12/5 or Monday 12/6 during class time.
Note that you can still **modify** your code after Milestone 2.
The product you present during the demo is what is used for grading purpose.

**Everyone has to show up on Monday 12/6. Attendance will be taken.**
