### Before starting this assignment

Review [Lecture 3](/lectures/3-html-css-jquery), especially the last few slides on creating ES6 classes and how to use jQuery in ES6 classes. You may also find the resources linked on the [lecture page](/lectures) helpful.

If you are completely new to jQuery, you might want to go through
[this tutorial](http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/)
on the jQuery website.

Note that for this assignment we are writing JavaScript imported _directly into the browser_ (check out `index.html` to see how this is the case). Thus, to "run" this app, all we have to do is open `index.html` in our browser (like Chrome or Firefox) and the imported JS files will be run. If we refresh the page, the JS files will be re-imported and run from the start. Using your browser's [developer tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) will be pretty useful in debugging this assignment and understanding the operations we are doing on the DOM.

<!-- Since we are writing straight to the browser (whereas last homework we [transpiled to an older version of JS](https://webpack.js.org)), to make our build work on Gradescope and on a significant number of browsers, we have to use an older version of JS syntax than in HW3. Namely:

- Use `var` instead of `let` or `const`
- Use `function(params) {...}` instead of `(params) => {...}` -->

**Do use ESLint to check styles, bad styles will make you lose points!**

Having said all that, let's get into it!

## Building a map builder

![map-builder](https://s3.amazonaws.com/riploventures/map-builder.gif)

This project will introduce you some important jQuery concepts while helping you design a map-building application. It will run entirely in the browser; you're going to submit the whole client-side application (well, the JS parts at least -- we'll provide the HTML and CSS). It's inspired a lot by Pokémon maps. Here's a general outline of the functionality:

1. Pick a swatch from the palette
2. Hover over the map canvas to see what the swatch will look like
3. Click on the canvas to paint with the selected swatch
4. Use the arrow keys to navigate a player sprite around the map

To begin, take a look at the provided HTML and CSS files that lay out the map building interface. There are a few files linked to the `index.html` web page:

- Styles in `main.css`
- The jQuery library in `lib/js/jquery-1.11.0.js`
- Scripts that you will produce in this assignment: `map-builder.js` and `player.js`

There are two main sections of concern in `index.html`: (1) the swatches palette at the top and (2) the map canvas below it. The map swatches are already populated for you and have associated tile images (they show up as background images applied through CSS). A palette swatch looks like this:

<Code code={`<li class="swatch water-se"></li>`} html />

`water-se` is the swatch name; **this will be the same class name applied to map tiles to build up the map**. A 'selected' swatch will have the special `selected` class applied to it - the default selected swatch should be 'grass'. **Do not change the default selected swatch to something other than 'grass' - we'll expect it to start out as 'grass' in our tests.**

Note that in CSS and jQuery, class names are selected with `.` and ID names are prefixed with `#`. To select a swatch with class name `'selected'`, for example, you can type:

<Code code={`$('.selected').doSomeStuffs(...)`} js />

**TODO:** Start off by creating a JavaScript class called `MapBuilder` to
encapsulate the map builder logic (this will make it easy to convert to a JS
plugin later on). Its constructor should be accept two arguments:

1. A jQuery element `$container` that represents the map-builder container. It should contain
   a `.palette` element and `.map` element within it. In the provided HTML page,
   you can immediately see that this corresponds to the `<div id="map-builder">`
   container in the document body. The constructor should save this provided
   `$container` (note the prepended `$` on jQuery variable names) to a field `$elem` in
   the `MapBuilder` class.

2. An _optional_ params object with `width` and `height` properties indicating how
   large the map should be in tile dimensions. When this argument isn't
   provided, the `MapBuilder` should resort to some reasonable stored defaults - in
   this case, a width of 30 and a height of 15.

<!-- _Note_: You may wonder why are not putting all the code into `main.js`, We're using the class more as a method of organization and encapsulation rather than for more "traditional" object-oriented purposes. However, note that this does allow us to pass a MapBuilder object to our Player class, which will greatly simplify things later on. -->

---

## Selecting swatches

![select-swatches](https://s3.amazonaws.com/riploventures/select-swatches.gif)

The first task will be to have `MapBuilder` keep track of which swatch is
currently selected in the palette. Visually (in CSS), we'll represent this with
the `'selected'` class on swatches. If the 'grass' swatch is selected, its
palette element looks like this:

<Code code={`<li class="swatch grass selected"></li>`} html />

**_TODO_**: Write a function in the `MapBuilder` class called
`setupPalette` that gets invoked in the builder constructor in `main.js`.
This setup function should bind a `click` handler to palette swatches that

1. Ensures only one swatch ever has the 'selected' class name (check out jQuery's
   [`addClass`](https://api.jquery.com/addclass/) and
   [`removeClass`](https://api.jquery.com/removeclass/) methods).
2. Stores the currently selected swatch name in the `MapBuilder` class.
   You'll probably want a helper function to extract the swatch name from a DOM
   element. It will be helpful to get access to the raw DOM element `classList`.
   For example:

<Code code={`
$grassSwatch = $('.swatch.grass') // jQuery element
grassSwatch = $grassSwatch.get(0) // DOM element
grassSwatch.classList // DOM NodeList, an array-like object
`} js />

**Debugging**: Try `console.log` the swatch name to the console every time the selected swatch changes. You ought to be able to click a bunch of swatches and see this value update to values like `'water-se'`, `'fence-nw'`, `'cave'`, etc.

<!-- <WarningMessage showIcon>
  Be sure to remove any <code>console.log</code> statements before submitting. It can trip up Gradescope under our configuration for this assignment and may cause your autograder build to fail.
</WarningMessage> -->

## Drawing the map canvas

**TODO**: Next, write another similar setup function `setupMapCanvas` in the `MapBuilder` class.
It should generate `<div>`s for the map tiles according to the provided map size
dimensions and insert them into the DOM inside the `.map` element. A 2 x 2 map
would look like this on the page:

<Code code={`
<div class="map">
  <h3>Map Canvas</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="tile swatch grass"></div>
    <div class="tile swatch grass"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="tile swatch grass"></div>
    <div class="tile swatch grass"></div>
  </div>
</div>
`} html />

If you use the same class names as listed here, the styles provided with the
assignment should work right off the bat.

As mentioned in lecture, it's possible to **generate** a DOM element with jQuery
by passing an HTML tag string to `$`, like this:

<Code code={`
var $newDiv = $('<div>')
 
// We can invoke jQuery methods on this new div
$newDiv.addClass('swatch')
`} js />

Until you write `$newDiv` into the `document`, however, it only exists in your
script. Take a look at jQuery's [`.append`](https://api.jquery.com/append/) method
to write elements into the page DOM.

_Note_: this layout could have been implemented with a `<table>` (it is, after
all, simply a grid), but using `<div>`s allows us to write simpler CSS.

## Previewing swatches

![preview-swatches](https://s3.amazonaws.com/riploventures/preview-swatches.gif)

While building our Pokémon level map, it would be nice to preview what a map
tile would look like in position on the canvas. There are a few ways you can
make this work with classes, some of which don't require edits to the provided
CSS file. A map tile simply looks like:

<Code code={`<div class="tile swatch grass"></div>`} html />

So if you swap out `'grass'` for another swatch name, it takes on that swatch's
appearance.

**TODO**: In `setupMapCanvas`, `MapBuilder` should bind event handlers to the
newly generated tiles. In particular, we are interested in the `mouseenter` and
`mouseout` events on each tile `<div>`. When the mouse hovers over a tile, it
should take the appearance of `MapBuilder`'s selected swatch.

- `mouseenter`: edit the tile's classes so that it appears to look like the
  selected swatch

- `mouseout`: restore the tile's original "painted-on" swatch appearance with
  classes

Remember that jQuery event handlers have this general form in ES6 classes:

<Code code={`
$myDiv.mouseenter(({ target }) => {
  // An event handler's context gets bound to its target element on the page.
  // The element currently selected is reflected by the parameter target.
  ...
})
`} js />

_Hint_: If you need to store information on a DOM element, it's common to use
a `data-` attribute. You can give this any name; it looks something like this:

```html
<li class="swatch grass" data-seq="1"></li>
```

You can then access these attributes in jQuery:

<Code code={`
var $grass = $('.swatch.grass')
 
$grass.data('seq') // --> '1'
$grass.data('seq', 2) // updates the 'data-seq' attr
`} js />

---

## Painting swatches

Now the fun part! To allow a user to "paint" a swatch (make it stay in place on
the map canvas), we'll make them click on a tile. That tile should then take the
appearance of the selected swatch.

![paint-swatches](https://s3.amazonaws.com/riploventures/paint-swatches.gif)

**TODO**: In `setupMapCanvas`, `MapBuilder` should bind a `mousedown` event
handler to the map tiles. This handler will be similar to `mouseenter`, but
you'll have to do something special to ensure that the swatch appearance doesn't
revert when the mouse leaves the tile.

**TODO**: In addition, you should implement tile painting by dragging. This
can all be done with just the `mousedown` and `mouseenter` events. Think about
what should happen to a tile when the mouse enters it AND the mouse button is
already clicked.

_Hint_: You can create a field in `MapBuilder` called `mouseIsDown` to distinguish
between previewing swatches and actually painting swatches.
<!-- 
<Code code={`
var LEFT_MOUSE_BUTTON = 1
 
$grass.on('mousedown', function(e) {
  e.which === LEFT_MOUSE_BUTTON // -> true
})
`} js /> -->

## A playable character

![preview-swatches](https://s3.amazonaws.com/riploventures/playable-character.gif)

It's time to get adventurous like Ash Ketchum and implement a playable character
within this map once it's built. There are sprites for Pikachu in all four orientations
(left, up, right, and down) in `lib/images/sprites` - they correspond to the classes
'facing-left', 'facing-up', 'facing-right', and 'facing-down' in the CSS.

We are going to implement a separate class called `Player` that generates a player on the map page.
This player can move around with the arrow keys.
They should be able to move over terrain (e.g. grass) but not through obstructions.

The `Player` constructor will take 3 arguments: an x-coordinate, a y-coordinate, and
an instance of the `MapBuilder` class. This is where making the `MapBuilder` class comes in handy -
we've assigned the `builder.$elem` to be the container for the entire map builder, and
we can access this from `Player` now. We can also tack on useful properties like `width`
and `height` to the builder and reference those from `Player`. Neat!

**TODO**: In the constructor of the `Player` class,
create an element for the player and add it to the DOM. Again, you'll need to
create an element by using the jQuery syntax:

<Code code={`
$('<div>').addClass('player facing-down')
`} js />

Once you've created the element, you'll need to add it to the DOM. The correct element
to add the player to is a child of the map builder element with the class name `.map`. If you
don't add it to the correct element, its position will be messed up!

**TODO**: In the constructor of the `Player` class, display the player element at the correct position on the page. You must do this
by setting the `left` and `top` properties in CSS. For instance, if the player's current coordinates are `(x, y)`, then you would set the `left` property to `(x * SWATCH_SIZE) + 'px'` and
the `top` property to `(y * SWATCH_SIZE) + 'px'`.

**TODO**: In the constructor of the `Player` class, listen for keydown events on `document` and move the player accordingly.

Actually listening for these events is pretty easy. You'll wrap the `document` in a jQuery object, and bind an event for `keydown`. You'll need to look at the _event object_ to determine which key was pressed. The key codes for [left, up, right, down] are [37, 38, 39, 40], respectively; and the relevant property is `event.which`.

The tricky part is determining whether a move is valid. You need to ensure that

1. The player does not go out of the map boundaries, and
2. The tile that the player is moving into is _terrain_ and not an obstacle.

We've provided you with a handy `isTerrain` function that, given a swatch name, will tell
you whether the player can be moved into it or not. However, you'll need to dig into the
map itself to determine the swatch name for a given coordinate.

**Hint**: Check out the [`.eq`](https://api.jquery.com/eq/) method in jQuery - it grabs
the nth object from a set of matches.

Make sure that you're changing the _orientation_ of the player on each move, regardless of
whether the move is valid or not. For instance, if the player starts off facing down at
`(0, 0)` and you receive a 'left' keydown event, you cannot move the player (since this
would run them off the map). However, you would _still_ change their orientation class to
'facing-left' even though the coordinates haven't changed.

Also, we want to make sure you are keeping to good style.
Split this logic up into instance methods defined in the `Player` class just like how you did for `MapBuilder`.
For instance, you can create instance methods `setOrientation`, `isValidMove`, 
and use them in the constructor through `this.setOrientation()`, `this.isValidMove()`.
