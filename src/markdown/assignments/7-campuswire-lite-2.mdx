<hr />

<p>ðŸ¥³ This is the last milestone of the last homework for the semester ðŸ¥³</p>

Recap: To prepare you better for the final project, you are going to build a more complicated website compared to what you did in HW4 and HW5.
That's why it consists of two milestones, you will have one week for each milestone.

**Please upload your code to the same repo you used for the last milestone**

## Final Product

![final product](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47411373/74400797-2addfa80-4ded-11ea-8635-71f11d9bc7cc.gif)

Our final application will be a really pared down version of Campuswire ("pared down" is an understatement) that allows you to list out a bunch of questions that only registered users have submitted. That being said
there is also a signup/login portion of this website with a persistent database.

With that idea in mind, let's dive in.

In milestone 1, you are going to create a backend with all the API endpoints that handle login/ logout and posts updates.

In milestone 2, you are going to connect the backend with a frontend React website to make things interactive.

<hr />

## Milestone 2: Frontend

**Refer to [lecture 9](https://github.com/cis197/live-code/tree/master/F2021/lecture9) updated code
for how to connect frontend and backend using *parcel***. You should follow the exact same boilerplate
(e.g. having a `frontend` and `backend` folder, using `concurrently` & `nodemon` or `node`)

**YOU DO NOT NEED REDUX FOR THIS HOMEWORK!** Everything should be handled using `useState`

### Frontend Routing
Since we have multiple components, we want them to have their own url. 
Refer to the [example in offical docs](https://reactrouter.com/web/example/basic) for how to set it up.

### Sign Up

The first component you need to create is the sign up page. You will need to configure the frontend routing
so that this component is available at `localhost:3000/signup` if you are using 3000 as the
port number for your `express` server.

![sign up](https://i.ibb.co/SchKCcL/cw-signup.png)

The above image describes what needs to be created:
- input boxes for username and password respectively
- a sign up button that sends a `POST` request to the backend `/account/signup` using `axios`
- a link that, once clicked, sends user to the `/login` page (the `<Link />` component from `react-router-dom` should be helpful, refer to the [link](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Link))

Also, there are a few requirements regarding sign up:
- if the user successfully signed up, you should redirect them back to the home page `/` (the `useHistory` function from `react-router-dom` is helpful here, here's the [link](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Hooks/usehistory))
- if the user failed to sign up, you should pop up an [alert](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert) using `alert(...)` and the user should remain on the `/signup` page

### Login

Similar to the `SignUp` component you just created, you need to configure the frontend routing
such that this `Login` component is available at `localhost:3000/login`

![login](https://i.ibb.co/PCL8LGT/cw-login.png)

You need to create
- input boxes for username and password respectively
- a login button that sends a `POST` request to the backend `/account/login` using `axios`
- a link that, once clicked, sends user to the `/signup` page

Similarly,
- if the user successfully logged in, you should redirect him back to the home page `/`
- if the user failed to log in, you should pop up an [alert](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert) and the user should remain on the `/login` page

### Home Page

Now comes the final and the most complicated component which is the home page.
This component should be available at `localhost:3000`

There are two states here: one where the user is logged in and one where the user is logged out.
Depending on the states, you need to render different things.
You might want to create a new API route in the backend that tells you whether a user is logged in or not.

Similar to how we handle errors above, you should use `alert` to create a pop up in case an error occurs.

**Logged Out**

![cw-logged-out](https://i.ibb.co/CbKNCGZ/cw-out-2.png)

If the user is logged out, 
- there should be a link, that once clicked, sends the user to `/login` page
- the user should be able to see a list of questions which includes the following only
  - the content of the question, i.e. `questionText`
  - the author of the question
  - the answer of the question

**Logged In**

![cw-logged-in](https://i.ibb.co/fdDKHyD/cw-in.png)

If the user is logged in,
- the user should be able to see his username displayed
- the user can click on a log out button to sign him off (`POST` to `/account/logout`)
- the user should see a "add new quetion" button that once clicked opens up a modal (refer to the GIF at the top of the page)
  which includes
  - a text box for entering question
  - a button for submitting a question that makes a `POST` request to `/api/questions/add`
  - a button to close the modal
- a list of questions where each question should includes (you need to send a `GET` request to `/api/questions`)
  - the content of the question, i.e. `questionText`
  - the author of the question
  - the answer of the question
  - a form for the user to submit an answer (the submit button will need to make a `POST` request to `/api/questions/answer`)

Last but not the least, the list of questions and answers should be **automatically updated after 2 seconds**.
That is, users should be able to see the updates without having to refresh.
You can test it out by creating two different users and having them logged in, one in normal mode,
and the other in incognito/ private mode.

Here's a hint on how you should do it: in your home page component, you should manipulate the
life cycle methods and repeat the action of getting the list of questions every 2 seconds.

<Code
  js
  code={`
useEffect(() => {
  const intervalID = setInterval(() => {
    ...
  }, 2000)
  // return a clean-up function so that the repetition can be stopped
  // when the component is unmounted
  return () => clearInterval(intervalID)
}, [])
`}
/>

But this is by no means the best way. If there are no questions in the database that are updated, then
keep fetching from DB is a waste of bandwidth and transactions which at the end of the day
increases your bill. Ideally, the backend should be smart enough to let the frontend know when
it needs to fetch the new batch of questions. Does that sound like we should use sockets instead?
Definitely! But **this is not required**. If you have time, go explore the solution using socket.io!

### Styles
Finally, some extent of styling is expected
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- CSS-related tools like [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) or [scss](https://sass-lang.com/)
